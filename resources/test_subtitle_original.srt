178
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,601
He's the only one who
could save the city.

179
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,136
He owes it to us.

180

181

We got a great-looking

Yeah!

Wow. Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.

199
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,265
So, everybody's heard
about the super rats that

200
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,866
- are in Gotham now, right?
- [audience] Yeah.

201
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,503
Well, today,
the mayor said he has a solution.

202
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,273
You ready for this?

203
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,640
Super cats.

204
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,209
[all laughing]

205
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:00,479
But in all seriousness,
I mean, these rats are...

206
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,181
[Arthur] I love you,
Murray!

207
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,983
[audience chuckling]

208
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,285
I love you, too.

209
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,952
[all laughing]

210
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,954
Hey, Bobby,
would you put the lights on?

211
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,155
Who is that?

212
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,359
Was that you?
You wanna stand up, please?

213
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,427
Stand up for me.

214
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,694
Go ahead.

215
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:22,768
What's your name?

216
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,903
Hi, Murray. Arthur.

217
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,772
- Arthur?
- My name's Arthur.

218
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,574
Oh, okay. Well,
there's something special about you,

219
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,742
Arthur, I could tell.

220
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,876
Where are you from?

221
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,778
I live right here
in the city

222
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,713
- with my [stammers] mother.
- [audience laughing]

223
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,082
[Murray] Okay, hold on. Hold on.

224
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,917
There's nothing funny
about that.

225
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,020
I lived with my mother before I made it.
Just me and her.

226
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,989
I'm that kid whose father went
out for a pack of cigarettes,

227
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,258
and he never
came back.

228
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,592
[audience] Aww.

229
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,294
[Arthur] I know
what that's like, Murray.

230
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,063
I've been the man of the house
for as long as I can remember.

231
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,132
I take good care
of my mother.

232
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:00,273
All that sacrifice,
she must love you very much.

233
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,007
She does.

234
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,978
She always tells me to smile
and put on a happy face.

235
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,747
She says I was put here to
spread joy and laughter.

236
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,582
[audience] Aww.

237
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,886
Wow.

238
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,158
I like that. I like that a lot.
Come on down.

239
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,161
Come on.
For that, you gotta come down.

240
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,762
- [audience cheering]
- Come on! Come on.

241
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,631
[upbeat jazz music playing]

242
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:32,938
Come on.

243
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,148
[audience cheering loudly]

244
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,390
Okay, we got a big show tonight.
Stay tuned.

245
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,825
We'll be right back.

246
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,394
That was great, Arthur.
Thank you.

247
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,429
I mean, I loved hearing
what you had to say.

248
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,729
It made my day.

249
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,232
Thanks, Murray.

250
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,033
You see all this,
the lights, the show,

251
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,601
the audience,
all that stuff?

252
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:03,802
I'd give it all up
in a heartbeat

253
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,205
to have a kid
like you.

254
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,089
[stretching shoe]

255

256
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,345
[sighs]

257
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,648
- [Randall] What's up, ladies?
- Hey, Randall. What's up?

258
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,518
Another day
in chuckle town.

259
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,784
[man] Yup.

260
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,290
You okay?

261
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,860
I heard about
the beatdown you took.

262
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,696
Fucking savages.

263
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,500
It was just a bunch of kids.
I should have left it alone.

264
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,134
No.

265
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,069
They'll take everything
from you if you do that.

266
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,971
All the crazy shit
out there.

267
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,007
- They're animals.
- [chuckles]

268
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,846
You know what?

269
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,052
Here.

270
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,290
What is it?

271
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,424
Take it.

272
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,426
It's for you.

273
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,963
[chuckling]

274
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,300
[Randall] You gotta
protect yourself out there.

275
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,167
Otherwise,
you're gonna get fucked.

276
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,003
Randall,

277
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,074
I'm not supposed to
have a gun.

278
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,645
Don't sweat it, Art.

279
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,079
No one
has to know.

280
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,583
And you can pay me
back some other time.

281
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,016
You know
you're my boy.

282
00:16:58,784 --> 00:16:59,918
[laughing]

283
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,454
[Gary] Arthur,

284
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,623
Hoyt wants to
see you in his office.

285
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,559
Hey, Gary.
You know what I've always wondered?

286
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,859
No idea.

287
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,728
Do you people call it
miniature golf

288
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,064
or is it just golf
to you?

289
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,765
[Randall and Arthur
laughing]

290
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,170
[man] Punch him in the
dick, Gary.

291
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,873
[laughing]

292
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,723
Hello, Hoyt.

293
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:39,259
Gary said you wanted to see me.

294
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:42,462
How's the comedy career?
Are you a famous stand-up yet?

295
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,762
Not quite.

296
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,864
Just been working
on my material.

297
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,933
No, don't sit.
This'll be quick.

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,669
Look,
I like you, Arthur.

299
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,069
You know,
a lot of the guys,

300
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,505
they think you're a freak,
but I like you.

301
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,974
I don't even know
why I like you.

302
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,211
But I got
another complaint.

303
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:01,179
It's starting to piss me off.
Kenny's Music.

304
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,181
The guy said
you disappeared.

305
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,950
Never even
returned his sign.

306
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,720
Because I got jumped.

307
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,622
Didn't you hear?

308
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,357
For a sign?

309
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,825
That's bullshit.
It doesn't even make sense.

310
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,728
Just get him
his sign back.

311
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,564
He's going out of business,
for God's sake, Arthur.

312
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,333
Why would
I keep his sign?

313
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,403
How the fuck do I know?
Why does anybody do anything?

314
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,506
If you don't
return the sign,

315
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,007
I gotta take it
out of your paycheck.

316
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,176
Are we clear?

317
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:35,281
Listen,
I'm trying to help you.

318
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,583
Okay? And I'll tell you
something else.

319
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,084
The other guys,

320
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,919
they don't feel comfortable
around you, Arthur,

321
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,988
because people
think you're weird.

322
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,924
Okay? And I can't
have that around me.

323
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,527
[Hoyt continues indistinctly]

324
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:53,999
[grunting]

[jabbing buttons]

327
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,709
[Sophie] Wait,
wait, wait.

328
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:37,976
Wait.

329
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,281
Thank you.

330
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,035
[GiGi giggles]

331
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,972
This building is so
awful, isn't it?

332
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:11,109
This building is so
awful, right, Mommy?

333
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,780
Yes, we can
hear you, GiGi.

334
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,749
It's so awful,
Mommy.

335
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:17,817
[imitates gunshot]

336
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,084
Right, Mommy?

337
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,990
[elevator bell dings]

338
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,327
- Good night.
- [GiGi] This building's

339
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,529
- so awful, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

340
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,063
- [baby crying]
- [man shouting]

341
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,335
Hey.

342
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,171
[imitates gunshot]

343
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,109
Come on.

344
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,717
[upbeat music playing]

345
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:53,719
[door closes]

346
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:04,530
- [Arthur] Look up.
- [Penny] Mmm.

347
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,666
Maybe the mailman's
throwing them away.

348
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:10,503
Mom, why are these letters
so important to you?

349
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,003
What do you think
he's gonna do?

350
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,207
He's gonna help us.

351
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,678
But you worked for him,
what, 30 years ago?

352
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,513
Why would
he help us?

353
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,082
Because Thomas Wayne

my clown name at work.

Are you having any negative thoughts?"

All I have are
negative thoughts,

630

listen anyway.

starting to notice.

our offices next week.

across the board.

speaking to his son.

to call the police?

about the two of them.

nothing to know.

was delusional.

a sick woman.

fool of yourself.

Slow and steady.
We got some stairs coming up.

814

815
00:55:30,263 --> 00:55:31,364
What happened?

816
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,131
- Who are you?
- I'm her son.

817
00:55:33,198 --> 00:55:34,700
- What happened?
- You can probably help us

818
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:36,502
out inside.
We don't know what happened yet.

819
00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:38,204
- Hop in the back of the ambulance.

Excuse me, sir.

827
00:55:54,353 --> 00:55:55,388
Does your mother take
any medications?

828
00:55:55,454 --> 00:55:56,522
- No.
- Excuse me,

829
00:55:56,589 --> 00:55:58,257
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.

830
00:55:58,324 --> 00:55:59,559
Sir, when was the last
time you spoke to her?

831
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:00,760
I don't know.

Sorry to bother you.
I'm Detective Garrity.

835
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:52,712
This is my partner,
Detective Burke.

836
00:56:52,778 --> 00:56:55,715
We had a few questions for
you, but you weren't home,

837
00:56:57,115 --> 00:56:58,718
so we spoke
with your mother.

838
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:01,520
Oh.

839
00:57:02,455 --> 00:57:04,056
What did you
say to her?

840
00:57:04,122 --> 00:57:05,190
Did you do this?

841
00:57:05,257 --> 00:57:06,759
What? No.

842
00:57:06,826 --> 00:57:09,028
No, no, no.
We just asked her some questions,

843
00:57:09,095 --> 00:57:10,763
and she got hysterical.

844
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:12,498
Hyperventilating,

845
00:57:12,565 --> 00:57:13,933
collapsed and hit
her head pretty hard.

846
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,535
Yeah. The doctor said
she had a stroke.

847
00:57:16,602 --> 00:57:19,105
We're sorry to
hear about that.

848
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:22,308
But, like I said,
I still have some questions for you.

849
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:23,576
They're about
the subway killings

850
00:57:23,643 --> 00:57:25,111
that happened
last week.

851
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:26,512
You've heard about them, right?

852
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:27,713
Yeah.

853
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,848
It's horrible.

854
00:57:28,914 --> 00:57:30,783
Right.

855
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:34,220
So, we spoke with your
boss over at Haha's.

856
00:57:34,286 --> 00:57:36,322
He said you were fired
for bringing a gun

857
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:38,156
into the children's hospital.

858
00:57:39,392 --> 00:57:41,427
- Is that true, Mr. Fleck?
- It was a prop.

859
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:43,396
It's part
of my act.

860
00:57:43,462 --> 00:57:44,797
I'm a party clown.

861
00:57:44,864 --> 00:57:47,198
All right.
So, why were you fired?

862
00:57:48,234 --> 00:57:50,168
[sighs heavily]

863
00:57:50,236 --> 00:57:52,938
They said
I wasn't funny enough.

864
00:57:53,005 --> 00:57:54,840
Can you imagine that?

865
00:57:54,907 --> 00:57:58,844
If you don't mind,
I have to go take care of my mother.

866
00:57:58,911 --> 00:58:01,514
[Burke] Your boss also
gave us one of your cards.

867
00:58:03,482 --> 00:58:05,951
This condition of yours,
the laughing,

868
00:58:06,752 --> 00:58:08,087
is it real,

869
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:10,389
or some sort
of clown thing?

870
00:58:10,456 --> 00:58:13,325
- A clown thing?
- Yeah.

871
00:58:13,392 --> 00:58:15,828
I mean, is it part of your act?

872
00:58:18,297 --> 00:58:19,765
What do you think?

873
00:58:25,504 --> 00:58:26,772
[Burke] It's exit only.

874
00:58:51,163 --> 00:58:53,365
She's gonna be okay.

875
00:58:57,536 --> 00:58:59,505
I'm gonna
get a coffee.

876
00:59:00,072 --> 00:59:01,140
You want one?

877
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,408
Yeah.

01:10:07,072 --> 01:10:08,541

1053
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:18,049
[indistinct announcement
on PA]

1054
01:10:26,859 --> 01:10:28,461
[clerk] Hey.

1055
01:10:28,528 --> 01:10:31,564
[sighs] Man,
I'm sorry about that, my man.

1056
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:33,800
All records 10 years or older,
they store in the basement,

1057
01:10:33,866 --> 01:10:37,270
and you're talking about
something 30 years ago, so...

1058
01:10:38,371 --> 01:10:40,606
Can I ask you
a question?

1059
01:10:40,673 --> 01:10:42,241
Sure.

1060
01:10:42,308 --> 01:10:47,246
How does someone
wind up in here?

1061
01:10:47,313 --> 01:10:51,551
Have they all,
all the people committed crimes?

1062
01:10:51,617 --> 01:10:53,219
Well, yeah, some have.

1063
01:10:53,286 --> 01:10:56,255
You know,
some are just crazy.

1064
01:10:56,322 --> 01:10:58,957
Pose dangers to
themselves and others.

1065
01:10:59,024 --> 01:11:00,493
Some just got
nowhere else to go.

1066
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,695
Don't know what to do, you know?

1067
01:11:02,762 --> 01:11:06,499
- Yeah. I hear you, brother.
- Hmm.

1068
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:10,803
Sometimes,
I don't know what to do.

1069
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:14,907
Last time, I ended up taking
it out on some people.

1070
01:11:14,973 --> 01:11:19,077
I thought it was gonna bother
me, but it really hasn't.

1071
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:21,347
What's that?

1072
01:11:22,582 --> 01:11:26,084
I fucked up and
did some bad shit.

1073
01:11:26,151 --> 01:11:27,353
[chuckles]

1074
01:11:30,021 --> 01:11:31,624
You know
what I'm talking about,

1075
01:11:31,691 --> 01:11:36,662
it's so hard to just try
and be happy all the time.

1076
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:41,234
Hey, listen, man.

1077
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,869
I'm just
an administrative assistant.

1078
01:11:42,935 --> 01:11:44,403
Like a clerk,
you know.

1079
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:46,339
All I do
is file paperwork.

1080
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,074
I don't know
what to tell you.

1081
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,042
But you should
see somebody.

1082
01:11:51,109 --> 01:11:52,311
You know,
they got programs,

1083
01:11:52,378 --> 01:11:55,080
city services,
stuff like that.

1084
01:11:55,146 --> 01:11:56,516
Oh, yeah.

1085
01:11:56,582 --> 01:11:58,284
[in high-pitched voice]
They cut all those.

1086
01:11:58,918 --> 01:12:00,453
[clerk laughs]

1087
01:12:03,222 --> 01:12:05,291
All right, here it is. Fleck.

1088
01:12:05,358 --> 01:12:08,159
Penny Fleck.
Let's see.

1089
01:12:08,227 --> 01:12:13,266
Diagnosed by
Dr. Benjamin Stoner.

1090
01:12:13,332 --> 01:12:17,436
Oh. "The patient suffers
from delusional psychosis

1091
01:12:17,503 --> 01:12:21,474
and narcissistic
personality disorder." Mmm.

1092
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:23,309
"Was found guilty
of endangering

1093
01:12:23,376 --> 01:12:27,112
the welfare
of her own child."

1094
01:12:35,153 --> 01:12:36,355
What?

1095
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:41,260
You said
she's your mother.

1096
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:47,767
Uh...

1097
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:49,869
I'm sorry, man. Like I said,
I can't release these records,

1098
01:12:49,936 --> 01:12:53,039
you know,
without proper forms.

1099
01:12:53,104 --> 01:12:55,408
I could
get in trouble.

1100
01:12:55,474 --> 01:12:57,777
Look, if you want to bring
your mom in here to sign,

1101
01:12:57,843 --> 01:12:59,478
that'll be much easier,

1102
01:12:59,545 --> 01:13:02,080
but I can't let this go
without her signature, okay?

1103
01:13:02,147 --> 01:13:03,349
I'm sorry.

1104
01:13:07,286 --> 01:13:10,056
No, man! Shit!

1105
01:13:10,121 --> 01:13:12,224
Come on, man.
Give it...

1106
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:15,394
Hey! Hey!

<i>We have all the
paperwork right here.</i>

1111
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:21,761
[Young Penny]
<i>That's not true.</i>

1112
01:14:21,827 --> 01:14:24,230
Thomas had that
all made up,

1113
01:14:24,296 --> 01:14:27,266
so it stayed
our secret.

1114
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:28,668

01:14:28,734 --> 01:14:31,904

of your boyfriends

1117
01:14:33,305 --> 01:14:36,876
repeatedly abused
your adopted son

1118
01:14:38,176 --> 01:14:39,378
and battered you.

1119
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:45,484
[laughing]

1120
01:14:58,998 --> 01:15:00,866
Penny,

1121
01:15:00,933 --> 01:15:04,904
your son was found
tied to a radiator

1122
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:07,373
in your filthy apartment.

1123
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,109
Malnourished with multiple
bruises across his body

1124
01:15:10,176 --> 01:15:12,178

to his head.

[Young Penny] I
never heard him cry.

1127
01:15:16,816 --> 01:15:20,586
He's always been such
a happy little boy.

need you to leave.

in the other room.

I always hated
that name.

1158

You know how you used to tell me

1159
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:26,091
that my laugh
was a condition?

1160
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:29,795
That there was
something wrong with me?

1161
01:20:32,664 --> 01:20:34,033
There isn't.

1162
01:20:36,735 --> 01:20:38,804
That's the real me.

Happy. Hmm.

1165
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:51,116
I haven't been happy

my entire fucking life.

1167
01:21:00,559 --> 01:21:02,094

what's funny?

You know what really
makes me laugh?

01:26:26,586 --> 01:26:27,886
Did you get
a new gig?

1227
01:26:28,454 --> 01:26:29,921
No.

1228
01:26:29,988 --> 01:26:33,292
Oh, you must be going down
to that rally at City Hall.

1229
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:35,160
I hear
it's gonna be nuts.

1230
01:26:35,228 --> 01:26:37,095
Oh, is that today?

1231
01:26:37,663 --> 01:26:39,332
Yeah.

1232
01:26:39,399 --> 01:26:41,133
What's with
the makeup then?

1233
01:26:42,502 --> 01:26:43,969
My mom died.

1234
01:26:44,035 --> 01:26:45,405
I'm celebrating.

1235
01:26:46,138 --> 01:26:47,206
Right. We heard.

1236
01:26:47,273 --> 01:26:48,875
That's why
we came by.

1237
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:51,778
We figured, you know,
you could use some cheering up.

1238
01:26:51,844 --> 01:26:53,613
[Arthur] Aw, that's sweet.

1239
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:57,149
But, no, I feel good.

1240
01:26:57,216 --> 01:26:58,984
Yeah, I stopped
taking my medication.

1241
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:00,952
I feel
a lot better now.

1242
01:27:02,855 --> 01:27:05,458
Oh, okay.
Good for you.

1243
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,329
So, hey, listen,
I don't know if you heard,

1244
01:27:10,396 --> 01:27:13,466
but the cops have been
coming around the shop,

1245
01:27:13,533 --> 01:27:17,503
talking to all the guys
about those subway murders.

1246
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,605
- And, um...
- They didn't talk to me.

1247
01:27:21,374 --> 01:27:24,477
That's because the suspect
was a regular-sized person.

1248
01:27:24,544 --> 01:27:27,346
If it was a fucking midget,
you'd be in jail right now.

1249
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,981
[Arthur laughing]

1250
01:27:32,984 --> 01:27:34,253
Anyway, um,

1251
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:38,391
Hoyt said that
they talked to you,

1252
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:39,892
and now
they're looking for me,

1253
01:27:39,958 --> 01:27:41,494
and I just wanna know
what you said.

1254
01:27:41,561 --> 01:27:43,362
Make sure
our stories line up.

1255
01:27:43,429 --> 01:27:46,332
- Seeing as how you're my boy.
- Yeah, that's important.

1256
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:48,201
- That makes a lot of sense.
- You know what I mean?

1257
01:27:48,267 --> 01:27:50,403
Thank you, Randall.
Thank you so much.

1258
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:51,737
- [Randall groaning]
- [Gary screaming]

1259
01:27:55,842 --> 01:27:57,310
[Gary] Arthur!

1260
01:27:57,376 --> 01:27:59,044
- No!
- [Randall's head thudding]

1261
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:01,314
What?

1262
01:28:02,582 --> 01:28:03,583
No!

1263
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:06,519
- [Arthur panting]
- [Gary sobbing]

1264
01:28:11,324 --> 01:28:13,459
Why would
you do that, Arthur?

1265
01:28:13,526 --> 01:28:16,229
- [breathing rapidly]
- [Gary continues sobbing]

1266
01:28:34,447 --> 01:28:36,782
Do you watch
The Murray Franklin Show?

1267
01:28:36,849 --> 01:28:38,384
- [Gary whimpering]
- Yeah.

1268
01:28:39,452 --> 01:28:41,621
I'm gonna be
on tonight.

1269
01:28:41,687 --> 01:28:43,322
[whimpering]

1270
01:28:45,525 --> 01:28:47,527
[in cockney accent]
It fucking crazy, innit?

1271
01:28:47,593 --> 01:28:49,462
Me on the telly.

1272
01:28:51,297 --> 01:28:53,466
What the fuck, Arthur?

1273
01:28:54,667 --> 01:28:55,735
[normal voice] What?

1274
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,208
It's okay, Gary.

1275
01:29:02,275 --> 01:29:03,609
You can go.

1276
01:29:03,676 --> 01:29:04,677
[Gary groaning]

1277
01:29:05,945 --> 01:29:07,647
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

1278
01:29:10,616 --> 01:29:12,117
Oh!

1279
01:29:12,183 --> 01:29:14,453
Don't look.
Just go.

1280
01:29:19,124 --> 01:29:20,326
[Arthur yells]

1281
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:22,795
[whimpering]

1282
01:29:26,899 --> 01:29:28,099
[crying] Fuck.

1283
01:29:28,834 --> 01:29:30,202
[sighs tearfully]

1284
01:29:33,138 --> 01:29:34,540
Hey, Arthur?

1285
01:29:34,607 --> 01:29:36,509
Yeah?

1286
01:29:36,576 --> 01:29:39,312
[stammering] Arthur,
can you get the lock?

1287
01:29:42,481 --> 01:29:43,783
Shit.

1288
01:29:43,849 --> 01:29:45,418
Sorry, Gary.

1289
01:29:56,228 --> 01:29:57,496
Gary?

1290
01:29:57,563 --> 01:29:58,564
Yeah.

1291
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,669
You were the only one
that was ever nice to me.

1292
01:30:05,738 --> 01:30:07,105
Skedaddle.

1293

Hey, Arthur!

1298
01:31:35,695 --> 01:31:37,129
We need to talk.

1299
01:31:37,195 --> 01:31:38,297
[Arthur] Oh!

1300
01:31:38,364 --> 01:31:40,566

Murray.

Hey, hey, hey.
It's Mr. Franklin, buddy.

1351
01:35:20,686 --> 01:35:23,188
Oh, come on, Gene.
That's all bullshit.

1352
01:35:24,257 --> 01:35:25,624
Thank you, Murray.

1353
01:35:26,592 --> 01:35:28,727
I feel like
I know you.

1354
01:35:28,794 --> 01:35:30,930
I've been
watching you forever.

1355
01:35:30,996 --> 01:35:32,164
Thank you.

1356
01:35:32,232 --> 01:35:33,599
What's with the face?

1357
01:35:33,666 --> 01:35:35,834
I mean,
are you part of the protest?

1358
01:35:35,901 --> 01:35:36,936
No.

1359
01:35:37,002 --> 01:35:39,339
No, I don't believe
in any of that.

1360
01:35:39,406 --> 01:35:41,308
I don't believe
in anything.

1361
01:35:41,374 --> 01:35:43,276
I just thought it'd
be good for my act.

1362
01:35:43,343 --> 01:35:44,944
For your act?
Didn't you hear

1363
01:35:45,010 --> 01:35:46,545
what happened on the subway?
Some clown got killed.

1364
01:35:46,612 --> 01:35:48,113
He's aware of that.
He's aware of that. Yeah.

1365
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,682
No, I hadn't heard.

1366
01:35:49,748 --> 01:35:51,016
- Yeah.
- You see? This is

1367
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:52,551
what I'm telling you.
The audience is

1368
01:35:52,618 --> 01:35:53,786
gonna go crazy
if you put this guy on.

1369
01:35:53,852 --> 01:35:55,688
Maybe for a bit,
but not a whole segment.

1370
01:35:55,754 --> 01:35:58,490
Gene, it's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

1371
01:35:58,557 --> 01:36:01,160
- We're gonna go with it.
- [Arthur and Murray laugh]

1372
01:36:01,227 --> 01:36:02,628
Thank you, Murray.

1373
01:36:02,695 --> 01:36:03,929
Couple rules, though.

1374

No cursing.
No off-color material.

1375
01:36:06,065 --> 01:36:07,499
We do a clean show.

1376
01:36:07,566 --> 01:36:08,767
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

1377
01:36:08,834 --> 01:36:10,437
You'll go on
right after Dr. Sally.

1378
01:36:10,502 --> 01:36:11,570
I love Dr. Sally.

1379
01:36:11,637 --> 01:36:13,005
Good, good.
Someone will

1380
01:36:13,072 --> 01:36:15,375
- come and get you, okay?
- Okay. Perfect.

1381
01:36:15,442 --> 01:36:16,542
Good luck.

1382
01:36:16,608 --> 01:36:17,810
- Thanks, Murray.
- Okay.

1383
01:36:18,777 --> 01:36:22,215
- Murray, one small thing.
- Yeah.

1384
01:36:22,282 --> 01:36:23,882
When you
bring me out,

1385
01:36:23,949 --> 01:36:25,918
can you
introduce me as Joker?

1386
01:36:25,985 --> 01:36:28,187
What's wrong
with your real name?

1387
01:36:28,254 --> 01:36:30,923
That's what you
called me on the show.

1388
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:32,157
A joker.

1389
01:36:32,225 --> 01:36:33,460
Do you remember?

1390
01:36:33,525 --> 01:36:35,395
- Did I?
- [Gene] I don't know.

1391
01:36:35,462 --> 01:36:37,997
Well, if you say so, kid,
you know, Joker it is.

1392
01:36:38,063 --> 01:36:39,131
It's good.

1393
01:36:39,198 --> 01:36:40,266
Thanks, Murray.

1394

[gun clicks]

1395
01:37:02,121 --> 01:37:03,722
[Murray] I'll try it,
you know,

1396
01:37:03,789 --> 01:37:05,492
but I'm not sure my
wife will let me do it.

1397
01:37:05,557 --> 01:37:06,792
[audience laughing]

1398
01:37:06,859 --> 01:37:08,261
Maybe my next wife.

I'm pretty sure this
guy could use a doctor.

1402
01:37:16,135 --> 01:37:17,370
- [audience laughing]
- [Dr. Sally] Oh!

1403
01:37:17,437 --> 01:37:19,038
Does he have
sexual problems?

1404
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,374
[Murray] Oh, he looks like
he's got a lot of problems.

1405
01:37:21,441 --> 01:37:23,008
[audience laughing]

1406
01:37:23,075 --> 01:37:25,378
All right, Bobby,
let's show that clip one last time.

[Arthur laughing
on video]

1408
01:37:31,384 --> 01:37:34,686
[Arthur] <i>I hated
school as a kid.</i>

1409
01:37:36,121 --> 01:37:39,225
<i>But my mother
would always say,</i>

1410
01:37:39,292 --> 01:37:41,093
[imitates Penny]
<i>"You should enjoy it.</i>

1411
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,962
<i>One day,
you'll have to work for a living."</i>

1412
01:37:44,029 --> 01:37:45,164
[normal voice]
<i>"No, I won't, Ma.</i>

1413
01:37:45,231 --> 01:37:47,367
<i>I'm gonna be
a comedian."</i>

1414
01:37:47,434 --> 01:37:49,302
[Arthur laughing on video]

1415
01:37:53,406 --> 01:37:57,142
- [Murray] Okay. You may...
- [audience laughing]

1416
01:37:57,210 --> 01:38:00,480
You may have seen that
clip of our next guest.

1417
01:38:00,547 --> 01:38:03,316
Now, before he comes
out, I just want to say

1418
01:38:03,383 --> 01:38:04,783
that we're
all heartbroken

1419
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:06,885
about what's going on
in the city tonight.

1420
01:38:06,952 --> 01:38:09,255
But this is how he
wanted to come out,

1421
01:38:09,322 --> 01:38:12,758
and honestly,
I think we could all use a good laugh.

1422
01:38:12,825 --> 01:38:16,061
So, please welcome, Joker.

1423
01:38:16,128 --> 01:38:18,331

[audience whooping
and whistling]

1426
01:38:57,669 --> 01:38:59,171
Are you
all right, Doctor?

1427
01:38:59,239 --> 01:39:00,672
[audience laughing]

1428
01:39:02,841 --> 01:39:05,411
Well,
that was quite an entrance.

1429
01:39:09,282 --> 01:39:11,116
[scattered laughter
from audience]

1430
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:13,051
You okay?

1431
01:39:15,721 --> 01:39:17,122
Yeah.

1432
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:20,159
This is exactly
how I imagined it.

1433
01:39:21,927 --> 01:39:23,795
Well, that makes
one of us.

1434
01:39:23,862 --> 01:39:25,365

01:39:25,431 --> 01:39:26,432
[audience applauding]

1436
01:39:30,669 --> 01:39:32,871
So, can you tell us
about this look?

1437
01:39:32,938 --> 01:39:34,574
When we spoke earlier,

1438
01:39:34,641 --> 01:39:36,509
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement.

1439
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,809
Is that right?

1440
01:39:37,876 --> 01:39:39,312
That's right, Murray.
I'm not political.

1441
01:39:39,379 --> 01:39:42,080
I'm just trying to
make people laugh.

1442
01:39:42,147 --> 01:39:44,350
- And how's that going for you?
- [audience laughing]

1443
01:39:45,218 --> 01:39:46,818
[laughing]

1444
01:39:52,225 --> 01:39:54,159
So, I know
you're a comedian.

1445
01:39:54,227 --> 01:39:56,094
You been working on
any new material?

1446
01:39:56,161 --> 01:39:57,463
You wanna
tell us a joke?

1447
01:39:58,398 --> 01:39:59,731
[audience applauding]

1448
01:40:03,236 --> 01:40:04,237
Yeah?

1449
01:40:06,372 --> 01:40:07,373
Okay.

1450
01:40:10,943 --> 01:40:12,445
[audience laughing]

1451
01:40:13,413 --> 01:40:15,113
He's got a book.

1452
01:40:15,847 --> 01:40:17,417
A book of jokes.

1453
01:40:27,092 --> 01:40:28,860
Take your time.
We got all night.

1454
01:40:28,927 --> 01:40:30,697
[audience laughing]

1455
01:40:32,332 --> 01:40:33,333
[Murray chuckles]

1456
01:40:34,634 --> 01:40:37,069
Okay, okay.
Here's one.

1457
01:40:39,972 --> 01:40:42,642
Knock, knock.

1458
01:40:42,709 --> 01:40:44,176
And you had to
look that up?

1459
01:40:44,244 --> 01:40:46,011
- [laughing]
- [audience laughing]

1460
01:40:46,078 --> 01:40:47,813
[audience applauding]

1461
01:40:51,083 --> 01:40:52,985
I want to
get it right.

1462
01:40:54,654 --> 01:40:56,356
Knock, knock.

1463
01:40:56,422 --> 01:40:58,023
Who's there?

1464
01:40:59,191 --> 01:41:00,792
It's the police, ma'am.

1465
01:41:00,859 --> 01:41:02,794
Your son's been hit
by a drunk driver.

1466
01:41:02,861 --> 01:41:05,764
- He's dead. [laughing]
- [audience gasps]

1467
01:41:05,831 --> 01:41:07,065
[plays sad note]

1468
01:41:07,132 --> 01:41:08,867
- [audience booing]
- Oh, no, no, no.

1469
01:41:08,934 --> 01:41:10,802
No, you cannot
joke about that.

1470
01:41:10,869 --> 01:41:12,705
Yeah, that's
not funny, Arthur.

1471
01:41:12,771 --> 01:41:15,941
That's not that kind of
humor we do on this show.

1472
01:41:16,008 --> 01:41:18,311
Okay. I'm...
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1473
01:41:18,378 --> 01:41:22,881
It's just, you know,
it's been a rough few weeks, Murray.

1474
01:41:22,948 --> 01:41:24,484
[chuckling]

1475
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:26,419
Ever since

1476
01:41:28,655 --> 01:41:31,224
I killed those three
Wall Street guys.

1477
01:41:31,291 --> 01:41:32,425
[all gasp]

1478
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:39,798
Okay, I'm waiting
for the punch line.

1479
01:41:40,999 --> 01:41:42,968
There is
no punch line.

1480
01:41:44,102 --> 01:41:46,205
- It's not a joke.
- [audience murmuring]

1481
01:41:50,743 --> 01:41:51,877
You're serious,
aren't you?

1482
01:41:51,943 --> 01:41:53,178
You're telling us
you killed

1483
01:41:53,246 --> 01:41:54,380
those three young men
on the subway?

1484
01:41:54,447 --> 01:41:55,381
[Arthur] Mmm-hmm.

1485
01:41:55,448 --> 01:41:57,216
And why should
we believe you?

1486
01:41:57,283 --> 01:41:59,452
I got nothing
left to lose.

1487
01:42:01,254 --> 01:42:03,489
Nothing can
hurt me anymore.

1488
01:42:05,291 --> 01:42:06,359
[laughs]

1489
01:42:06,426 --> 01:42:09,928
My life is
nothing but a comedy.

1490
01:42:09,995 --> 01:42:11,930
[audience booing]

1491
01:42:13,031 --> 01:42:14,367
Well, let me
get this straight,

1492
01:42:14,434 --> 01:42:16,536
you think that killing
those guys is funny?

1493
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:18,538
I do.

1494
01:42:18,604 --> 01:42:21,374
And I'm tired of
pretending it's not.

1495
01:42:21,441 --> 01:42:23,842
Comedy is subjective,
Murray.

1496
01:42:23,909 --> 01:42:25,745
Isn't that
what they say?

1497
01:42:25,812 --> 01:42:27,680
All of you,

1498
01:42:27,747 --> 01:42:30,283
the system
that knows so much,

1499
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:33,185
you decide
what's right or wrong.

1500
01:42:33,252 --> 01:42:38,624
The same way that you
decide what's funny or not!

1501
01:42:39,891 --> 01:42:41,427
[man] Get him off!

1502
01:42:41,494 --> 01:42:45,465
Well, okay,
I think I might understand

1503
01:42:45,531 --> 01:42:47,099
that you did this to
start a movement,

1504
01:42:47,165 --> 01:42:49,802
to become a symbol?

1505
01:42:49,868 --> 01:42:51,371
Come on, Murray.

1506
01:42:51,437 --> 01:42:52,772
Do I look like
the kind of clown

1507
01:42:52,839 --> 01:42:54,374
that could
start a movement?

1508
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:57,377
I killed those guys
because they were awful.

1509
01:42:57,443 --> 01:43:00,112
Everybody is awful
these days.

1510
01:43:00,178 --> 01:43:02,482
It's enough to
make anyone crazy.

1511
01:43:02,548 --> 01:43:04,417
[Murray] Okay.
So, that's it, you're crazy.

1512
01:43:04,484 --> 01:43:07,119
That's your defense for
killing three young men?

1513
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:09,154
No.

1514
01:43:09,222 --> 01:43:12,891
They couldn't carry a
tune to save their lives.

1515
01:43:12,958 --> 01:43:14,360
[audience booing]

1516
01:43:14,427 --> 01:43:18,531
Oh, why is everybody so
upset about these guys?

1517
01:43:18,598 --> 01:43:20,366
If it was me
dying on the sidewalk,

1518
01:43:20,433 --> 01:43:22,000
you'd walk
right over me!

1519
01:43:22,067 --> 01:43:24,237
I pass you every day,
and you don't notice me.

1520
01:43:24,303 --> 01:43:26,506
But these guys, what,
because Thomas Wayne

1521
01:43:26,572 --> 01:43:28,274
went and cried about them on TV?

1522
01:43:28,341 --> 01:43:30,643
You have a problem
with Thomas Wayne, too?

1523
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:32,512
Yes, I do.

1524
01:43:32,578 --> 01:43:36,181
Have you seen what it's
like out there, Murray?

1525
01:43:36,249 --> 01:43:39,352
Do you ever actually
leave the studio?

1526
01:43:39,419 --> 01:43:43,556
Everybody just yells and
screams at each other.

1527
01:43:43,623 --> 01:43:45,625
Nobody's civil anymore.

1528
01:43:45,691 --> 01:43:50,128
Nobody thinks what it's
like to be the other guy.

1529
01:43:50,195 --> 01:43:53,031
You think men like
Thomas Wayne ever think

1530
01:43:53,098 --> 01:43:55,133
what it's like to be
someone like me?

1531
01:43:55,201 --> 01:43:58,069
To be somebody but themselves?
They don't.

1532
01:43:58,136 --> 01:44:00,239
They think that
we'll just sit there

1533
01:44:00,306 --> 01:44:02,974
and take it,
like good little boys!

1534
01:44:03,041 --> 01:44:05,378
That we won't werewolf
and go wild!

1535
01:44:05,445 --> 01:44:06,813
You finished?

1536
01:44:06,879 --> 01:44:09,415
I mean, it's so much
self-pity, Arthur.

1537
01:44:09,482 --> 01:44:11,116
You sound like
you're making excuses

1538
01:44:11,183 --> 01:44:12,585
for killing
those young men.

1539
01:44:12,652 --> 01:44:14,720
Not everybody,
and I'll tell you this,

1540
01:44:14,787 --> 01:44:16,322
not everyone is awful.

1541
01:44:18,357 --> 01:44:19,792
You're awful, Murray.

1542
01:44:19,859 --> 01:44:21,828
Me? I'm awful?

1543
01:44:21,894 --> 01:44:23,696
Oh, yeah,
how am I awful?

1544

Inviting me
on this show.

1546
01:44:31,504 --> 01:44:34,907
You just wanted to
make fun of me.

1547
01:44:34,973 --> 01:44:36,809
You're just like
the rest of them.

1548
01:44:36,876 --> 01:44:38,878
You don't know the first
thing about me, pal.

1549
01:44:38,945 --> 01:44:41,881
Look what happened,
because of what you did. What it led to.

1550
01:44:41,948 --> 01:44:43,583
There are riots
out there.

1551
01:44:43,649 --> 01:44:45,218
Two policemen are
in critical condition,

1552
01:44:45,284 --> 01:44:46,652
- and you're laughing.
- [laughs]

1553
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:48,186
You're laughing.

1554
01:44:48,254 --> 01:44:50,790
Someone was killed today,
because of what you did.

1555
01:44:50,857 --> 01:44:52,425
I know.

1556
01:44:54,694 --> 01:44:56,262
How about another joke, Murray?

1557
01:44:56,329 --> 01:44:57,964
No, I think we've had
enough of your jokes.

1558
01:44:58,063 --> 01:44:59,265
- What do you get...
- I don't think so.

1559
01:44:59,332 --> 01:45:02,033
...when you cross
a mentally-ill loner

1560
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:04,437
with a society
that abandons him

1561
01:45:04,504 --> 01:45:05,805
and treats him
like trash?

1562
01:45:05,872 --> 01:45:07,340
Call the police, Gene!

1563
01:45:07,406 --> 01:45:08,574
- I'll tell you what you get!
- Call the police.

1564
01:45:08,641 --> 01:45:10,309
You get what you
fucking deserve!
